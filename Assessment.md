# Job Platform Automation Challenge

## Challenge Overview
Develop an automated solution to interact with one major job board platform. It scrape job from  any of the board you select below and also apply to at least 5 jobs on that board. This exercise evaluates your technical approach, problem-solving methodology, and documentation skills - not the ultimate success/failure of the implementation.

## Platform Options
Choose **one** platform to target:
- 🏢 Greenhouse
- 🔍 Indeed  
- 💼 LinkedIn
- 📌 ZipRecruiter

## ⏱️ Timeline
**48 hours** from receiving access to resources

## ✅ Requirements

### Core Objectives
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials (use environment variables/secure input)
- ✅ Screenshot documentation for each major step
- ✅ Functional job search implementation
- ✅ Application submission attempt
- ✅ Clear failure handling

### Technical Implementation
- Use any programming language/tools
- Demonstrate:
  - Secure authentication
  - Search parameterization
  - Application logic
  - Error recovery

## 📝 Submission Deliverables

1. **Source code** (committed to repository)
2. `/screenshots` directory containing:
   - Authentication process
   - Search results
   - Application attempts
   - Error states
3. Comprehensive `README.md` (using this template)
